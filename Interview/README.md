## Interview Booking Process

### 1. Availability Check:
Please begin by checking my availability in my calendar. To gain access, click on the [link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bmlybWFscmVud2FsQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ) to request access or provide your Gmail ID. Once I grant you access, you can add my calendar to yours, and it will display in your time zone.

If there are no available slots, I can refer you to one of my colleagues who best suits your requirements.

### 2. Booking a Slot:
Once a slot is available, please let me know the date, time (with time zone), and duration of the interview, along with the job description. If everything is aligned, we can proceed to confirm the booking.

Please note that the slot will only be officially booked once I have received the payment. If there is any delay in payment or if the slot is taken by someone else before payment is made, you will need to select a new available slot.

1. Gmail ID

## Interview Process:

We will connect via **WhatsApp or Zoom** based on the type of interview.

Please ensure you are wearing earphones connected to your phone and that noise cancellation is turned off. Test the connection by calling a friend and playing an interview video for 5 minutes to confirm clarity.

## Screen Control Setup:

I will send you a document containing your introduction and project details 5 minutes before the interview to your Gmail. If you prefer, you may use your own version, but ensure it includes all relevant business terms and project details.

I will also provide an **Otter link** for backup transcription, but please note Otter is only 80-90% accurate. It’s best to focus on the voice and use Otter sparingly. For coding or screen sharing, close Otter on your laptop and keep it open on your mobile device.

---

## Interview Etiquette:

- Speak slowly and clearly, matching your pace with mine.
- If the interviewer asks you to remove earphones, rely on Otter for transcription.
- When screen sharing, share only the browser window, not your entire screen (unless specifically requested).

---

## Tips:
- If you face any issues with Otter or audio, politely inform the interviewer and request to rejoin the call after resolving the issue.
- I do not provide previous Otter links due to confidentiality, but you can practice with YouTube captions.

---

## Terms and Conditions:

- Once the interview is booked and payment is made, **NO REFUNDS**  will be issued.
- If the interviewer does not attend or there are network issues during the interview, there will be **no refund**.
- In case your interview ends early (e.g., after 30 minutes in a 1-hour slot), **NO REFUNDS**  will be given.
- If you request to reschedule befoew 3 working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), I may be able to accommodate based on availability, but **NO REFUNDS** will be provided.

For interviews that may extend, please inform the interviewer about your next scheduled call and request not to extend.  
Ensure you receive confirmation from the recruiter or vendor before booking a slot.  
If your interview is expected to last 45 minutes, please book a 1-hour slot.

Also please start your call form complete hour means like 9,10,11,12 rather then 9:30 , 10:30 . In case of non complete hour 30 min charges would be extra.  
If you anticipate needing extra time, I suggest booking an additional 30 minutes in advance.
